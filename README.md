# Check if Vietnamese words
This project is used to check if a word is from Vietnamese.
# Description:
* This system can be combined with many NLP systems. Example: In graphemes to phonemes problem (g2p) eVitnamese, we need to detect a word is from vietnamese or not. If not, this word will be passed through the g2p system. Instead of detect Latin words, we can detect Vietnamese word and the rest will be latin words.
* This project is also used to check correct spelling in Vietnamese.
* This project is only developed by me.
